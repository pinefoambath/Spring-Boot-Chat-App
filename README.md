This is a first demo app  I made to learn how to use the Java Spring framework and Spring Boot, and the associated MVC and Thymeleaf dependencies. The app simulates a local chat group, users can post messages and read all messages created by all users. Next I'll be looking into how to add a DB and protected user credentials to this.
